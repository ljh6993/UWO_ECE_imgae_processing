The highest peak is slightly deviated from the correct value. NMI worked better with multi modal image registration and NCC worked better with mono modal. The two images are taken with different modalities from two different objects. The pixel intensities are different which is bad for MSE. From the graph, we can see a relativily larger plateau for NCC before it climbed to the peak value, where NMI has clear peak value.\n",
