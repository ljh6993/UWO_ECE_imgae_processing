Whereas the MSE and NCC don't give the best optimal value. Their minimum and maximum value just near the correct registration value. Besides, the NMI worked better with multi modal image registration and NCC worked better with mono modal. The pixel intensities are different which is bad for MSE. from the graphs,we can also find out that the NMI has a clear peak, and the local optima has more distance from the black dashed line\n",
